# Firebase Configuration Test

## Server-Side Error Fix Summary

I've fixed the server-side error you were experiencing when hosting. Here are the key changes made:

### 1. **Fixed Firebase Admin SDK Initialization**
- Updated `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` to properly handle both local and hosted environments
- Added proper error handling and initialization checks
- Made the SDK initialization more robust for Firebase App Hosting

### 2. **Enhanced Email Service**
- Updated `src/app/send-email.ts` to use the new Firebase Admin SDK function
- Added better error handling for server-side operations
- Improved logging for debugging

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
- The app now properly handles both local development and hosted environments
- Firebase App Hosting will use automatic credentials discovery
- Local development uses the service account JSON from your `.env.local`

## Testing Before Deployment

### Local Test
1. Make sure your development server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Try submitting the form locally at `http://localhost:9005`

3. Check the browser console and terminal for any errors

### Deployment Checklist
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK properly configured
- ✅ Environment variables set up
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ Logging enhanced for debugging

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If you still get server errors:
1. **Check Firebase App Hosting logs** in the Firebase Console
2. **Verify environment variables** are set in Firebase App Hosting
3. **Ensure Firebase Authentication and Firestore are enabled**
4. **Check that your Firebase project has the correct permissions**

### Environment Variables for Hosting
Make sure these are set in your Firebase App Hosting environment:
- `MAILJET_API_KEY`
- `MAILJET_API_SECRET` 
- `MAILJET_SENDER_EMAIL`
- `MAILJET_TEMPLATE_ID`
- `MAILJET_STANDARD_TEMPLATE_ID`

The Firebase Admin SDK will use automatic credentials discovery in the hosted environment.
